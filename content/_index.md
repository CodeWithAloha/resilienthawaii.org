## Introduction

This is a crowdsourced resource of trusted, curated + editorial links specific to Hawaii concerning the novel coronavirus global pandemic (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2). To neighbor island folk, we really need your help filling in the gaps; our networks are primarily on Oahu. Here are example cities ([NYC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WYGoVlJuXYc3QFN1RABnARZlwDG3aLQsnNokl1KhZQ/edit), [LA](https://laist.com/2020/03/18/coronavirus-los-angeles-covid-19-explained.php)) that we are modeling this document after. Let’s do our best to not recreate the wheel. We encourage you to [make suggestions to the content in this document](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6033474).

**We are doing our best effort to maintain this page, but like everything else you read on the internet, please check the source to make sure it’s up to date!**

## Immediate Needs

### Symptoms/When should you get screened?

To help manage available healthcare resources for the public statewide, the **DOH advises everyone to take the following steps:**

1. Stay home if you are not well or experiencing mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.

2. To prevent the potential spread of the virus, call ahead to your healthcare provider **BEFORE** going to a medical facility.

3. If your doctor would like you to come in for a screening, bring a photo ID and insurance card.

4. If your doctor decides that you meet the criteria for COVID-19 testing, he or she will provide a lab order for the test and take the swab for testing.

5. The specimen will be sent to a private or state lab for the results.

6. During this time, you are expected to self-quarantine at home until the test results are available, which could be up to 3-4 days, maybe longer.  

Please note that conditions are changing rapidly and screening options may change. Thank you for your kokua and understanding.
