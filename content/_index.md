## Introduction



This is a crowdsourced resource of trusted, curated + editorial links specific to Hawaii concerning the novel coronavirus global pandemic (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2). To neighbor island folk, we really need your help filling in the gaps; our networks are primarily on Oahu. Here are examples that we are modeling this document after: [NYC United Against Coronavirus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WYGoVlJuXYc3QFN1RABnARZlwDG3aLQsnNokl1KhZQ/edit), [Tech:NYC](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/12KbEKMrLrZf-nUvuHoFtLPHAARIDEc7kcWTUwBnI8dw/edit&sa=D&ust=1585458826721000&usg=AFQjCNFuLDspcRvdcNBKQk5OQfte3mzaCQ), [COVID-19 Los Angeles Mass Resource List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-WJaMa4q3yNrEBfSFKEdSQArcNc_MTI2LiUA63Ycyg/edit#). Let’s do our best to not recreate the wheel. We encourage you to [make suggestions to the content in this document](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6033474). If you would like to help translate this document into **Illocano, Tagalog, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Hawaiian, Korean, Samoan, Vietnamese or your language of choice**, please email us [hawaiicovidresources@gmail.com](mailto:hawaiicovidresources@gmail.com).

## Immediate Need

### Symptoms/When should you get screened?

To help manage available healthcare resources for the public statewide, the Hawaii **Department of Health (DOH) advises everyone to take the following steps:**

1. Stay home if you are not well or experiencing mild to moderate flu-like symptoms.

2. To prevent the potential spread of the virus, call ahead to your healthcare provider **BEFORE** going to a medical facility.

3. If your doctor would like you to come in for a screening, bring a photo ID and insurance card.

4. If your doctor decides that you meet the criteria for COVID-19 testing, he or she will provide a lab order for the test and take the swab for testing. If your doctor is unavailable when you call, they should follow CDC protocol and ask questions to help determine a diagnosis and whether you need to go to an urgent-care provider for tests for COVID19, Influenza A, and/or Influenza B.

5. The specimen will be sent to a private or state lab for the results.

6. During this time, you are expected to self-quarantine at home until the test results are available, which could be up to 3-4 days, maybe longer.  

Please note that conditions are changing rapidly and screening options may change. Thank you for your kokua and understanding.
